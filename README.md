# stage_manager

A simple scipt to help me logging my work hours and tasks done during my internships.

- Continuously update a markdown file storing hours task performed each day in a readable format.
- Store arrival and departure time at the beginning and end of the day as well as meals.
- Provide a plot of your hours and a summary of the lack or excess of time performed.
